                At UNC Dude Bro Cinema, we’re not just a movie club—we’re a community of cinephiles who live for the thrill of the big screen and the debates that come with it. Founded for students who want more than the usual Netflix binge, our club is all about experiencing films the way they were meant to be enjoyed: with friends, snacks, and plenty of laughs. We meet twice a month to screen a mix of all-time classics, cult favorites, and the latest blockbusters. From The Godfather to Good Will Hunting, Fight Club to The Matrix, we make sure there’s something for everyone. And because no movie night is complete without fuel, we always provide food and drinks for our members to snack on while soaking in the action. But UNC Dude Bro Cinema isn’t just about watching movies—it’s about community, conversation, and fun. We’re here to geek out over film history, debate iconic scenes, and discover hidden gems together. Whether you’re a hardcore film nerd, a casual fan, or just here for the good vibes, you’re welcome in our crew. Our mission is simple: bring people together through movies. We stand for inclusivity, camaraderie, and creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing opinions, cracking jokes, and enjoying the magic of cinema. So grab a seat, a snack, and your best movie trivia—because at UNC Dude Bro Cinema, every night is a chance to make memories and experience films like never before.

                On top of our regular screenings, UNC Dude Bro Cinema takes movie nights to the next level with theme nights, throwback marathons, and interactive watch parties. After each screening, we host a discussion where members can debate scenes, share their thoughts, and vote on upcoming films. Members also get the chance to write reviews that get featured on the club’s Letterboxd page, showing off your hot takes and film expertise. It’s the ultimate place to meet fellow movie buffs, flex your film trivia skills, and turn every screening into a legendary experience you won’t forget.
